## :innocent: Motivation
From past few years, Netflix has become very famous as a choice to watch movies and tv shows online. But did you ever think - how many series are there? Or how many movies they have? Which country has most movies available? This list goes on! So out of this curiosity, I came up with this visualization project to know more about Netflix.
